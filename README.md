Reputy React JS Task:
The task was to recreate two static landing pages (one web, one mobile) in HTML and CSS, before moving to React JS in order to improve the wireframes and make the site more responsive and adaptible.

Contents:
This repo contains two versions of the project: 'HTML_CSS_only' contain only the static version of the webpage as asked for in task 1, whereas React_JS contains the React version as asked for in task 2.

How to run:
Locate to 'App.js' located in the src folder, and run the command 'npm start'. Ensure your terminal is in the correct folder ('React_JS') if the page does not automatically open in your browser.
